# UnrealTut_BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4

This is part of a tutorial that I'm following at Udemy the Unreal course, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse)

These are just the files I created from followung part 4 of the course and to learn how to use Github.

Cheers.
